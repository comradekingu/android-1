# Building

EteSync uses `git-submodules`, so cloning the code requires slightly different commands.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/etesync/android etesync-android`
2. Change to the directory `cd etesync-android`
3. Open with Android studio or build with gradle:
  1. Android studio (easier): `android-studio .`
  2. Gradle: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
  
To update the code to the latest version, run: `git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules`

Third Party Code

This project relies on many great third party libraries. Please take a look at the
